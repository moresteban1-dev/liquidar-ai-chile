# Web Application Testing

To test local web applications, write native Python Playwright scripts.

## Helper Scripts Available

`scripts/with_server.py` - Manages server lifecycle (supports multiple servers)

**Always run scripts with `--help` first to see usage.** DO NOT read the source until you try running the script first and find that a customized solution is absolutely necessary. These scripts can be very large and thus pollute your context window. They exist to be called directly as black-box scripts rather than ingested into your context window.

## Decision Tree: Choosing Your Approach

1. **User task** → Is it static HTML?
    * **Yes** → Read HTML file directly to identify selectors
        * **Success** → Write Playwright script using selectors
        * **Fails/Incomplete** → Treat as dynamic (below)
    * **No (dynamic webapp)** → Is the server already running?
        * **No** → Run: `python scripts/with_server.py --help`
            * Then use the helper + write simplified Playwright script
        * **Yes** → Reconnaissance-then-action:
            1. Navigate and wait for networkidle
            2. Take screenshot or inspect DOM
            3. Identify selectors from rendered state
            4. Execute actions with discovered selectors

## Example: Using `with_server.py`

To start a server, run `--help` first, then use the helper:

**Single server:**

```bash
python scripts/with_server.py --server "npm run dev" --port 5173 -- python your_automation.py
```

**Multiple servers (e.g., backend + frontend):**

```bash
python scripts/with_server.py \
  --server "cd backend && python server.py" --port 3000 \
  --server "cd frontend && npm run dev" --port 5173 \
  -- python your_automation.py
```

## Creating Automation Scripts

To create an automation script, include only Playwright logic (servers are managed automatically):

```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=True) # Always launch chromium in headless mode
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto('http://localhost:5173') # Server already running and ready
    page.wait_for_load_state('networkidle') # CRITICAL: Wait for JS to execute
    # ... your automation logic
    browser.close()
```

## Reconnaissance-Then-Action Pattern

1. **Inspect rendered DOM:**

    ```python
    page.screenshot(path='/tmp/inspect.png', full_page=True)
    content = page.content()
    page.locator('button').all()
    ```

2. **Identify selectors** from inspection results
3. **Execute actions** using discovered selectors

## Common Pitfall

* ❌ Don't inspect the DOM before waiting for networkidle on dynamic apps
* ✅ Do wait for `page.wait_for_load_state('networkidle')` before inspection
